            <li>4-5 tablespoons coconut oil (or peanut oil, olive oil, or use butter or ghee) divided</li>

            <li>3 garlic cloves, rough chopped ( or try garlic scapes!)</li>
            <li>4 cups chopped veggies: carrots, mushrooms, cabbage, bok choy, asparagus, kale, bell pepper, broccoli,  broccolini, zucchini, snow peas, green beans, baby spinach, kale.</li>
            <li>1 cup shelled edamame or peas (frozen)</li>
            <li>3 cups cooked, cold, dry rice (or brown rice) see notes</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce or GF Liquid aminos</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste- or 1/4 teaspoon each</li>
            <li>1/4 cup scallions</li>
            <li>1-2 teaspoons Furikake or toasted sesame seeds</li>
         
        </ul>
    
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In an extra-large non-stick skillet, heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium heat and scramble the eggs or tofu. If using tofu, blot it dry first, and break it apart into little bits with the spatula in the pan. Season with a little salt and pepper ( and if you want your tofu yellowish, add a pinch of turmeric). Set aside on a large plate. See notes.</li>

            <li>In the same pan, heat oil over medium, and saute the leeks or onion. Once tender add the garlic, saute 1-2 minutes. Lower heat to medium and add longer cooking veggies first like carrots and mushrooms, then add the other veggies, leaving the greens, kale or cabbage to add at the end. Toss in the frozen edamme and give a stir, and set the veggies aside next to the tofu (or scrambled eggs).</li>

            <li>Add enough oil to lightly coat the pan. Add the rice, spreading it out. Turn up heat to med-high, and let it get a little crispy, resisting the urge, to constantly stir. Flip the rice big sections,  using a spatula and crisp up the other side. Once the rice is crispy enough to your liking, add back in the tofu (or eggs) and the veggies. Give a good stir to combine. Add the soy sauce, sesame oil and salt and pepper to taste.  If adding the Hondashi, stir in a little at a time. Adjust soy sauce and sesame oil, adding more if you like.</li>

            <li>Divide among bowls and top with fresh scallions and Furikake or toasted sesame seeds.</li>

            <li>Fried Rice will keep up to 4 days in the fridge and can be reheated on the stovetop or in a microwave.</li>

        </ol>
